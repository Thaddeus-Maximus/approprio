## Location

We're in glorious and free New Hampshire - a land of balance and the New England spirit. Specifically, we're building out of the [Manchester Makerspace](https://manchestermakerspace.org) and leveraging the great community here.

## Mission

We seek to use technology in such a way that it helps us to grow in virtue and communion. We believe that the average man can use machines in a healthy fashion, and that we arenâ€™t doomed to a technocratic dystopia. We believe the way out is through machines that people understand and can commune with.

Because we believe in a world of productive everyday people; a world where goods are produced and used locally and tangibly rather than being lost in a web of alienating work. Because we believe in the good life - the contemplation of the Divine through all things.

## Design Principles

We strive to apply good social and moral teaching to our work whenever possible.

1. [Small is beautiful.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful)
2. Extensibility and repairability are essential.
3. [Work was made for man, not man for work.](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens.html)
4. [Problems should be solved by the closest person/system.](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html)
5. We should build things that last.
6. [Often, the solution lies in removal, not addition.](https://suckless.org/philosophy/)
