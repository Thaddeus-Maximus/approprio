## Location

We're in glorious and free New Hampshire - a land of freedom, innovation, and tradition. Specifically, we're building out of the [Manchester Makerspace](https://manchestermakerspace.org) and leveraging the great community here.

## Mission

We seek to develop technology so that it helps us to grow in virtue and communion; **to seek the good life: meaningful work, goods, and leisure.** We believe that the average man can use technology in a healthy fashion, and that we arenâ€™t doomed to a technocratic dystopia. We believe the way out is through **technology that reasonably adept people grok and commune with**, rather than feeling ostracized and alientated.

## Design Principles

We strive to apply good social and moral teaching to our work whenever possible.

1. [Small is beautiful.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful)
2. [Extensibility](https://www.machinaeexdeo.com/p/extensible-technology) and repairability are essential.
3. [Work was made for man](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens.html), not man for work.
4. [Empower the closest person/system.](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html)
5. We should build things that last, [but how is not always obvious.](https://wrathofgnon.substack.com/p/the-100-year-well)
6. Often, the solution lies in [removal, not addition.](https://suckless.org/philosophy/)
7. Ordinary people should [actually own things](https://doctorow.medium.com/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors-bc93f471b9c8).
