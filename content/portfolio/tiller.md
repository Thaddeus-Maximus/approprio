A sailor broke the tiller handle for his sailboat. We could have either made a direct replacement, or designed and built a new one. We did the latter to add some additional functionality.

This new tiller handle is able to sit flatter and withstand the expected forces that a person could exert on it, and includes provisions for potential expansion that he asked for - the ability to mount a standard bicycle disc brake on the top so it could be used as a tiller tamer.
